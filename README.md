# Secure Notes — Time-Bound Encrypted Note App

Secure Notes is a lightweight web application that allows users to securely store, manage, and access personal notes — even after a login session expires. New users can register with a username, password, and a custom session duration. Returning users log in, optionally reset the session timer, and access their notes. Once the timer expires, notes remain accessible without requiring a password, offering convenience while keeping earlier sessions protected.

Users can create notes with a title (defaults to “Untitled” if empty) and content. Each note is timestamped and listed in a simple dashboard. Notes can be opened and viewed by clicking the title, and optional deletion is protected by a confirmation prompt. The application is designed for simplicity, privacy, and ease of use — suitable for quick note-taking with optional security.
