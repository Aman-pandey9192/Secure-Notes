 two-page secure note-taking web application that allows users to store, view, and manage their personal notes with time-bound password protection.

🚀 Features
Two User Modes:

New users can register with a username, password, and choose a session duration.

Existing users can log in with updated timer options.

Password Expiration Logic:

On login, the timer resets to the newly selected duration.

After the timer expires, users can access notes without a password.

Notes Page:

Create notes with a title and content (default title is “Untitled”).

Each note is timestamped and listed with clickable titles for quick viewing.

Security Feedback:

Incorrect password attempts show remaining time left until password becomes optional.
